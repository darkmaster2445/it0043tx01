                        General balance adjustments<br>
                        Increased critical hit damage<br>
                        Decreased recovery time after a missed critical hit.<br>
                        poise damage of attacks that occur after missing a critical hit.<br>
                        Bug Fixes and other changes<br>
                        Adjusted the player damage animation so that the attack direction is not unintentionally shifted
                        when getting hit while attacking with some types of weapons that generates poise.<br>
                        Fixed a bug that prevented some spells and incantations from causing damage while under the
                        effect of some skills and items.<br>
                        Fixed a bug that caused the effects of the Sacred Order skill to continue after switching
                        weapons.<br>
                        Corrected some text in certain languages.<br>

                <h2>Margit the Fell Omen</h2>
                <p>Margit is an Omen who gained notoriety during The Shattering, in which he slaughtered countless
                    champions who harbored ambitions for Lordship, stacking high their corpses during the Second
                    Defense of Leyndell.</p>

                <h2>Malenia</h2>
                <p>Malenia was born the child of Queen Marika the Eternal and her second husband, the Elden Lord
                    Radagon. She had an elder twin brother by the name of Miquella.</p>

                <h2>Radagon</h2>
                <p>Radagon is a tall, fractured god wielding the hammer that shattered the Elden Ring, and is found in
                    the Elden Throne. He was previously married to Rennala, but became Queen Marika's consort after
                    Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between. Completing Brother Corhyn & Goldmask's quest to a certain
                    point reveals that he is the "other half" of Queen Marika. Despite being of one body, the two do not
                    share the same will, as evident from Radagon attempting to repair the Elden Ring after Marika had
                    shattered it.</p>
