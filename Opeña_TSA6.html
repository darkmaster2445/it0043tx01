                Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder, captain, and
                strongest
                combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the
                legendary
                treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold
                dream
                (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means
                having the
                most freedom in the world.

                Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, Roronoa Zoro, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" in some English adaptations), also known
                as "Pirate
                Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro), is a fictional character created by Japanese manga artist
                Eiichiro Oda who
                appears in the manga series and media franchise One Piece. He first appeared in the third chapter of the
                One Piece
                manga, published in the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1997. Zoro is the first crewmate to join
                Monkey D. Luffy to
                be part of his crew of pirates, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro is a highly skilled
                swordsman and
                serves as the crew's combatant,[a] though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs
                as a running
                gag throughout the series.
